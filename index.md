## Who is BabaYagaBrig?

My name is Brig Lowell. I have a passion for technology and software. I even ran a multi-million dollar ecommerce business buying/selling/repairing iphones.  Unfortunately, unforseen circumstances forced me to move on from my business. It was a great oppurtuninty for me, gaining invaluable experience.

I made the choice to go back to school. I am currently a Student at BoiseState uninversity, working on my Bachelor of Computer Science. Hopefully will be graduating Fall 2019 or Spring 2020. I plan on staying in the valley when I graduate and am on the lookout for any local internships.

When I am not working on school, I spend time with my wife and two beautiful daughters. Juggling family and school has been a fun adventure. They are my everything, and my motivation to keep moving forward to provide them with a comfortable life.

### Areas of Interest:

**Gaming:**
Being an avid gamer, I am interested in developing games.
Growing up with a nintendo controller in hand, I feel I 
have a good understanding on gaming markets and interest.
I have worked on a few games with my brothers in pre-built 
design software e.g. RPG Maker. 

**Apps:**
Having an entrepreneurial mind leads me to wanting to work
on apps/app-design. I brainstorm constantly with friends and
collegues on what we would like to see/design in the app world.
My experience from school already has me working on a few ideas.
